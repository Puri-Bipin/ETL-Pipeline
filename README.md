# Data Warehouse and ETL Pipeline
## **Project Overview:**


This project aims to create a data warehouse and implement an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline to enable efficient data storage, analysis, and reporting. The ETL pipeline extracts data from a SQL Server database, performs necessary transformations using Python and pandas, and loads the transformed data into Google BigQuery, a scalable and robust data warehouse solution.

## **Project Components:**

Extract: Data is extracted from SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), a relational database management system, and saved as a CSV file. The extraction process ensures that the relevant data is retrieved for further processing and analysis.

Transform: The extracted data is transformed using the pandas library in Python. This step involves performing data manipulations, calculations, aggregations, and grouping operations to derive meaningful insights from the data. Transformations include calculating total sales, profit, average sales, and grouping the data by category, segment, and country.

Load: The transformed data is loaded into Google BigQuery, a powerful data warehouse solution. BigQuery provides a centralized repository for structured and organized data, optimized for querying and reporting. The loading process involves mapping the transformed data to the defined table schema and efficiently inserting it into the target tables in BigQuery.

## **Project Benefits:**

Centralized Data Storage: The project establishes a centralized data repository where relevant data from SSMS can be stored and accessed. This eliminates the need to navigate through multiple data sources, ensuring data consistency and easy data retrieval.

Data Analysis and Reporting: By implementing the ETL pipeline, valuable insights can be derived from the transformed data. Calculated metrics such as total sales, profit, and average sales enable informed decision-making. Grouping the data by category, segment, and country provides a comprehensive view of sales patterns and customer behavior.

Data Quality and Reliability: The ETL process ensures data quality and reliability by cleaning, validating, and standardizing the data. This improves data integrity and reduces the risk of erroneous analysis or decision-making based on faulty data.

## **Future Enhancements:**

Real-time Data Integration: Implementing real-time or near real-time data integration capabilities to capture and process data as it is generated, providing up-to-date insights for real-time decision-making.

Advanced Data Transformations: Expanding the range of data transformations to include more complex operations such as data deduplication, data standardization, and predictive analytics.

Automation and Orchestration: Developing automated processes and workflows to streamline the ETL pipeline, including scheduling data extraction, transformation, and loading tasks.

Data Governance and Security: Strengthening data governance practices, implementing robust security measures, and ensuring compliance with data privacy regulations.

Scalability and Performance Optimization: Continuously monitoring and optimizing the performance of the data warehouse, including query performance, data loading speed, and storage capacity.

## **Dependencies:**

pandas: A powerful data manipulation library in Python. <br>
pyodbc: A Python library for connecting to SQL Server databases.<br>

## **Getting Started:**

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

Install the required dependencies mentioned above.<br>
Set up SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) and create a database.<br>
Modify the connection details in the extract.py file to connect to your SSMS database.<br>
Modify the transformation logic in the transform.py file according to your requirements.<br>
Set up Google BigQuery and create a project and dataset.<br>
Authenticate your Python environment with Google Cloud using appropriate credentials.<br>
Modify the connection details and table schema in the load.py file to match your BigQuery setup.<br>
Run the main.py script to extract, transform and load the transformed data into Google BigQuery.<br>
Explore and analyze the data in BigQuery using SQL queries or visualization tools.<br>

## **Conclusion:**

By implementing a data warehouse and ETL pipeline, this project provides a streamlined approach to data storage, 
transformation, and analysis. The combination of SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) for data extraction, 
pandas for data transformation, and Google BigQuery for data warehousing enables organizations 
to make data-driven decisions based on reliable, centralized data. 
The project can be further enhanced and customized to meet specific business requirements and accommodate future data growth.
